## Overview

This project showcases common React patterns and TypeScript usage through three interactive components:

- **User Card**: API integration with loading states and error handling

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI library with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting

## Development

The application uses a simple tab-based navigation to switch between different components. Each component demonstrates different React and TypeScript concepts:

1. **State Management**: Local component state with hooks
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces and type annotations
3. **Event Handling**: User interactions and form submissions
4. **Side Effects**: API calls and lifecycle management
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Loading states and error handling

## Learning Objectives

This project helps practice:

- React functional components and hooks
- TypeScript type definitions and interfaces  
- State management patterns (useState, useReducer)
- API integration and async operations
- Event handling and user interactions
- Performance optimization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Form validation and user input handling
- Data manipulation and transformation
- Modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
- Build tools and development workflow

## Practice Implementation Guide

### Getting Started with Practice Components

1. **Choose a component** based on your current skill level:
   - **Beginner**: Start with WeatherWidget for basic API integration
   - **Intermediate**: Try ShoppingCart for state management practice
   - **Advanced**: Implement FormValidator or DataTable for complex patterns

2. **Follow the TODO comments** in each component file - they provide step-by-step guidance

3. **Read the learning objectives** at the bottom of each component file

4. **Test your implementation** by adding the component to App.tsx navigation

### Implementation Tips

- Read through the entire component file before starting
- Implement interfaces and types first
- Follow the TODO comments in order
- Test each piece of functionality as you build it
- Don't hesitate to look up React/TypeScript documentation
- Compare your implementation with the existing completed components

### Bonus Challenges

Each practice component includes bonus challenges at the bottom for additional learning opportunities once you complete the basic implementation.

## Testing

This project uses **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** for comprehensive component testing.

### Getting Started with Testing Practice Components

1. **Remove `.skip`** from the describe block in the test file you want to work on
2. **Follow the TODO comments** in each test - they provide step-by-step guidance
3. **Run tests in watch mode** to get immediate feedback: `npm test`
4. **Implement one test at a time** - start with basic rendering tests
5. **Study the completed tests** for patterns and best practices

### Testing Best Practices

- **Test user behavior**, not implementation details
- **Use semantic queries** (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`) over `getByTestId`
- **Test accessibility** - ensure components work with screen readers and keyboards
- **Mock external dependencies** (APIs, timers) for reliable tests
- **Write descriptive test names** that explain what behavior is being tested
- **Group related tests** in describe blocks for better organization

### Testing Tools Used

- **Vitest**: Fast test runner with ES modules support
- **React Testing Library**: User-centric testing utilities
- **jsdom**: Browser environment simulation for tests
- **@testing-library/user-event**: Realistic user interaction simulation
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Additional DOM matchers

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
